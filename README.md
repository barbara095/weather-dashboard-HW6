This application is designed to assist travellers in making their destination choice.

To ensure compatibility across all devices, the application is mobile and desktop responsive.

When you type in a city name, followed by a comma and the country code, the current weather conditions are displayed, including the current, min. and max. temperatures, wind speed and humidity. 

When I am shown the UV index, the value is colour coded according to the severity of the UV index. 

I am also presented with a 5 day forecast which shows me the same weather attributes.
