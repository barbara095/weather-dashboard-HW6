# Weather-dashboard-HW6

This application is designed to assist travellers in planning their trip based on current and future weather conditions.

To ensure compatibility across all devices, the application is mobile and desktop responsive.

When you type in a city name, followed by a comma and the country code, the current city, date and time is displayed. I am shown the current weather conditions, including the current, min. and max. temperatures, wind speed and humidity. 

When I am shown the UV index, the value is colour coded according to the severity of the UV index. 

I am also presented with a 5 day forecast which shows me the same weather attributes.
